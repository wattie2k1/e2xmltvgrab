# e2xmltvgrab
e2xmltvgrab is a little php script to grab epg data from an enigma2 based receiver and outputs a XMLTV file. The script is meant to be run from commandline, but should work through a webserver too.

The channels.xml is used to define which channels should be included to the XMLTV output. The config.inc.php needs to be configured with your parameters.
